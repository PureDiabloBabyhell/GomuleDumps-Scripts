# GomuleDumps-Scripts

To be used into a GoMule directory.

The python scripts work on GoMule dumps to avoid any interference with real stashes and item loss.

Current version status:
- Tested using Python 3.9.1 on Windows 10: shall be compatible with Python any 2.5+ versions.
- File names are set into the non-dicos python scripts.
- Generates PureDiablo compatible BBCODE to be copied into any post.
- Content is crunched based upon the defined dicos' content: those are still to be completed.
